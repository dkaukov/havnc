# Changelog

Notable and less notable changes. 

## [0.0.9]

- Improve security (where improve actually means add some basic security so not everyone on the network can access your HA dashboard).
**Note**: Because a password is required the upgrade will end with a error telling you to check the supervisor logs. It's because there is no password set. After the upgrade, go to Configuration and add a password and then start the add-on again.

## [0.0.8]

- Initial public release.
